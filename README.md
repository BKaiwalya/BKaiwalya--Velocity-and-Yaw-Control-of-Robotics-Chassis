**_Details_**:
-	Project involved precise locomotion analysis of a two wheeled robot.
-	gotoXY(x, y) algorithm which facilitated traversal of the robot to prescribed co-ordinates  (X, Y).
-	A system featuring closed loop feedback from gyroscope (yaw) for locomotion and encoders for Co-ordinate Mapping. 
- The microcontroller used was Atmel ATmega 2560.
-	Software development in C/C++
